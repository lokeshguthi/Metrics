Account
-------

All users (students, tutors, admins, ...) need an account in the system.
An account can be have different roles:
it is possible to be a student in one course and a tutor in another course.

You need to [register](registration.md) to get your account.


Course
------

A course in ExClaim is a organizational entity that contains exercise sheets, groups, and exams.


### Exercise Sheet

An exercise sheet is a collection of assignment.
Students can upload their solutions to each of the assignments.


### Group

A group is a collection of students that have their exercise session (if any) at the same time.
All groups from a course have the same exercise sheets.

#### Tutor

Tutors are assigned to groups and are responsible for grading the exercise sheet submissions from that group's students.

#### Team

A team is a collection of students from the same group.
They submit their solutions together -- uploads from either team member count as the submission from the whole team.

!!! attention
    Students can upload submissions only if they are assigned to a team.


### Exam

An exam is a test where students from all groups participate.
ExClaim can manage registration for exams and publication of results (individual result visible to each student and an overall statistic).
